Welcome to Puppet Script!
===================


### Quick jump

[TOC]


### Introduction

Trouble setting up your favorite linux distro by searching commands online and taking up your valuable time ? Puppet script is here. :grin:

Puppet script is built with python with community-level integration support. **Meaning**, anyone of you can add commands to this project without any knowledge of coding or even pint of sweat. See the **contributions wiki**

----------


How it works ?
-------------

Before you start running this script let me tell you how it works so that everyone can add their favorite apps or themes or whatever package you like :grin:.

> **Working:**

> - **cl** - a.k.a Commands list file is the main heart of puppet-script. It contains list of commands that puppet-script algorithm is capable of choosing, which package to install depending upon user choices.
> - **shells** - Shells are nothing but shell scripts with updated list of commands so that you don't need to update this script **EVER**. (nice right?) 

#### <i class="icon-file"></i> [WIP] Create your own puppet list

Now that you know how it works developers and themers can create their own puppet list. Look up **Wiki** for detailed instructions.



----------


Installation
-------------------

The script is so dynamic that it can fetch latest/up-to-date cl and shells to for you without you doing anything. 

Copy paste this one line code to execute puppet script:

**Running for the first time ?**
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codekidX/puppet_script/master/puppet.py && python puppet.py
```

How to normally run it after the first time:

```sh
python puppet.py
```
